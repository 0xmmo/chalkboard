# Chalkboard :woman_teacher:

### :loudspeaker: Hola Professoras!! It's time to make your online classes more interesting, engaging and fun with this simple application. Get the classroom feel with a realistic chalkboard, chalk and the duster. You can write notes too now!! <br/><br/>

> ***Download the repo, get handy with the application, and go on to schedule your next class!! <br/>Your students won't miss your classes from now. <br/> And, please do not forget to flaunt off in front of other teachers*** 

<br/>Existing Repo presented a fullscreen Javascript canvas implementation of a chalkboard with a realistic chalk effect and touch support.

In my work, I have introduced display of subject and topic name, today's date, a clear board button to clear the whole canvas, and a collapsible notes box.

**Instructions for use:** 
- Left click and drag to draw
- Right click and drag to erase
- Press space bar or click on clear board button to clear the chalkboard
- Click save then download to save a copy of the chalboard (not functions in all systems because os security issues)
- Hold and drag the notes container to move it around.
- Click on 'click here to expand/collapse' for adding notes.
